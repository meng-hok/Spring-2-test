    let card_5_des = `This is a lightweight, powerful motorcycle optimized for speed and handling rather than comfort – and for quick rides over short distances.[1] With bodywork and control layout recalling early-1960s Grand Prix road racing motorcycles, café racers are noted for their visual minimalism, featuring low-mounted handlebars, prominent seat cowling and elongated fuel tank – and frequently knee-grips indented in the fuel tank.`;
    let card_6_des = `Prepare for an assault on the senses. Southeast Asia has a bellyful of thundering motorbikes, fiery volcanic peaks, seething jungle temples and pungent markets. Yet we also love it for its squeaky-clean sands, barely believable islands and pagodas overlooking lily-topped lotus ponds. From temples to tropical rainforests, here are the top ten places to visit in Southeast Asia – as voted for by you. `;
    let card_7_des = `Kinabalu National Park, a UNESCO world heritage site in Sabah, Malaysia, is home to one of the tallest mountains in Southeast Asia. Each year, over 40,000 people from all around the world head to Kinabalu National Park just to climb Mount Kinabalu. Completing the climb commonly takes two days, and people of varying ages undertake this challenge. Despite the high elevation, no special equipment or climbing expertise is required to reach the summit – just a reasonable level of fitness combined with top-notch determination will do!`;
    let card_8_des = `Mount Ijen is a stratovolcano in East Java, Indonesia. The highest point of the volcano complex belongs to the famous, most active volcano in the country, Mount Merapi. A highly recommended site on Mount Ijen is the Blue Fire Crater. Hikers usually set off early in the morning (about 2 am) to reach the rim of the crater in time to witness the magical phenomenon of blue flames, which can only be seen in the dark. Hiring a guide is unnecessary as the pathway is prominent. Hikers will find themselves alongside friendly locals who undertake this hike every day to get to the sulphur mines.`;
    let card_9_des = `Mount Rinjani is a massive, active volcano towering over the island of Lombok, Indonesia. It is the second highest volcano in Indonesia, and its summit promises one of the best views you can ever imagine. Conquering it is no breeze, however. Mount Rinjani welcomes trekkers through two routes: the northern side, closer to the main resort area as well as the eastern side, which is closer to the summit. Due to previous fatal accidents, hiring a certified guide has been made compulsory by the authorities of Rinjani Park. It typically takes trekkers four days to reach the summit. Those who are not up for this arduous journey can content themselves with hiking to the gorgeous crescent-shaped crater lake Segara Anak (child of the sea), and the Aik Kalak natural hot spring.`;
    let card_10_des = `Vietnam’s highest peak, dubbed as “the Roof of Indochina”, is a very steep mountain that is only recommended for those in excellent shape. It takes a minimum of three days to scale to the peak and get back down. Mount Fansipan has rugged terrains, and hikers require plenty of energy and endurance. Once you spot a triangle metal piece that says “Fansipan 3,143m” on it, you know you’ve made it.`;
